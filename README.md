This project was made following the classes from 

[The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/)

This proejct has some adaptations to use elixir 1.5 , and others because I found errors.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
